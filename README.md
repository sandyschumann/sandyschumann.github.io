I am a social and political psychologist at the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). My research examines risk factors of radicalisation and extreme political attitudes, online and offline.

### News January 2020
* I will attend the second workshop of the co-creative action research group on using arts and culture to counter violent extremism, facilitated by the UAE Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development (10.-12.1.20).



### Current Research Projects

* A Reinforcing Spiral of Populist Attitudes: Are populist attitudes and social media use mutually reinforced over time?
* Immigration and Votes for Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe: Does an increase in the size of the immigrant population in a country have long term effects on voting behaviour?
* Support for Terrorism and Democracy Over Time: Is support for terrorism and lack of support for democracy related? Can these relationships be modelled over time?
