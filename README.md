I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) and the Postgraduate Tutor at University College London, [Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). My research examines risk factors of radicalisation, extreme political attitudes, as well as hate crime and hate speech prevention. I study these phenomena 'online' as well as 'offline'. Additionally, I am passionate about meta-research, improving research methods and analyses procedures.

I am keen to translate my research into policy and practice. Doing so, I advise governments (e.g., UK Commission on Countering Extremism, UAE Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development) and collaborate with civil society organisations to conduct impact evaluations.

Currently, I am the module convenor of the undergraduate course 'Terrorism' and the post-graduate module 'Online Hate Crime and Extremism'. In addition, I lead the fortnightly [JDI Open](jdiopen.github.io) seminar series on open science practices and innovative statistical methods.

### Current Research Projects

* Information seeking and support for violent extremism: I examine the relationship between active selection of and inicidental exposure to radicalising information and support for violent extremism
* Measurement invariance: Using data from the World Value Survey, I assess the importance of testing for measurement invariance in cross-national research 
* Public perceptions of measures to remove online hate speech: I explore how citizens perceive the distinction between online hate and free spech, current measures to remove online hate speech, and the freedom-security trade-off
