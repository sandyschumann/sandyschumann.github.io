I am a Lecturer at the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute) and study risk factors of radicalisation, extreme political attitudes, as well as hate crime prevention in increasingly diverse and digital societies. I am keen to translate academic research into policy and practice; I am looking forward to connect with policymakers and practitioners working in the field of CVE and hate crime prevention.

### News March 2020
* On 7.3. I spoke at Waltenstow Forest Citizens Assemply about the role of bystanders in preventing hate crime.
* We published a new [pre-print](https://osf.io/c4esm/) reporting a study that examined why (or why not) victims of sexual and gender-based violence decide to diclose their experience on Twitter.

### News February 2020
* I have been invited to write an article for the Brussels-based magazine Bruxelles Laïque on the role of social media for civic and political engagment.
* Our talk on 'The dynamic relationship between social media use and populist attitudes' has been accepted to this year's conference of the International Society for Political Psychology (July 2002 in Berlin).

### News January 2020
* I will attend the second workshop of the co-creative action research group on using arts and culture to counter violent extremism, facilitated by the UAE Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development (10.-12.1.20).
* I will start working with Dr Noémie Bouhana on a systematic literature review 'State of the Union: A Sythesis of Recent Evidence for Multilevel Drivers of Involvement in Terrorism', funded by the Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats (January-July 2020).
* We published our [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1556-4029.14282) on base rates of risk factors of engagement in violent extremism in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. 


### Current Research Projects

* A Reinforcing Spiral of Populist Attitudes: Do populist attitudes become more extreme as people use social media more frequently to access news? With Franziske Ehrke and Fabian Thomas (University Koblenz-Landau, Germany)
* Measuring Support for Terrorism in the General Population: How did support for suicide terrorism change over a period of 11 years? Does the answer to this question differ when we consider different approaches to assess public opinions? 
* Bystander Intervention in Ethnic Hate Crime: Where and when do people intervene? How can we facilitate intervention online?
With Tristan Caulfield (UCL, UK)
