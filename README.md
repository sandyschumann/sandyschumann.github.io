I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at University College London, [Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). My current research examines the interplay between (social) media/information/communication/technology and hate/(violent) extremism/radicalisation in different permutations. I take an interdisciplinary approach and work in the borderlands of communication science, social psychology, and terrorism studies. I am also passionate about meta-research, improving research methods and analyses procedures in extremism and terrorism studies. In the past, I have studied risk factors of radicalisation more broadly, computer-mediated intergroup contact, and online collective action. 

I am keen to translate my research into policy and practice. Doing so, I advise governments (e.g., UK Commission on Countering Extremism, UAE Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development) and collaborate with civil society organisations, such as [Soliya](https://soliya.net/impact), to conduct impact evaluations.

I serve as the program director of the MSc Countering Extremist Crime and Terrorism. Furthermore, I am the module convenor of the undergraduate course 'Terrorism' and the post-graduate module 'Online Hate Crime and Extremism'. 

In 2018, I founded [JDI Open](jdiopen.github.io), a seminar series on open science practices and innovative statistical methods. Since 2023, I am a co-lead of UCL's chapter of the UK Reproducibility Network.

### Current Research Projects

* Resilience to hate speech online: I examine who is less likely to be affected by the negative/desensitising impact of exposure to hate speech
* Perceptions of hate speech online and offline: I assess how hate crime is perceived in different settings as well as how bystander intervention can be encouraged online
* Long-term effects of attitudinal inoculation: I investigate moderators of the persistence of inoculation effects in the context of extremist attitudes
* p-curve ananlysis: I conduct a p-curve analysis of all published work that explores the effect of terrorism on political attitudes and behaviour
