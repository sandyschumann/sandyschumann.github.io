I am a Lecturer and the Postgraduate Tutor at the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). My research examines risk factors of radicalisation, extreme political attitudes, as well as hate crime prevention. I am keen to translate academic research into policy and practice; I am looking forward to connect with policy makers and practitioners in the field of CVE and hate crime prevention.


### Current Research Projects

* Hate Crime during COVID-19: Did ethnic and race hate crime increase since the first COVID-19 case was reported in the UK? Did hate crime incidents online increase since social distancing measures were introduced?
* Measuring Support for Terrorism in the General Population: How did support for suicide terrorism change over a period of 11 years? Does the answer to this question differ when we consider different approaches to assess public opinions? With Bettina Rottweiler and Paul Gill (UCL, UK)
* Bystander Intervention in Ethnic Hate Crime: Where and when do people intervene? Why are people more likely to intervene in more serious incidents? With Tristan Caulfield (UCL, UK)
* Does Cognitiv Inflexibility Predict Extremist Attitudes?: A registered direct replication of Zmirod et al., 2019 With Nadine Salman and Caitlin Clemmow (UCL, UK)
