I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) and the Postgraduate Tutor at University College London, [Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). My current research examines questions that pertain to the interplay between media and hate (crime or speech), extremism, as well as radicalisation. I take an interdiciplinary approach and work in the borderlands of communication science, social psychology, and terrorism studies. I am also passionate about meta-research, improving research methods and analyses procedures in terrorism studies. In the past, I have studied risk factors of radicalisation more broadly, computer-mediated intergroup contact, and online collective action. 

I am keen to translate my research into policy and practice. Doing so, I advise governments (e.g., UK Commission on Countering Extremism, UAE Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development) and collaborate with civil society organisations to conduct impact evaluations.

I am the module convenor of the undergraduate course 'Terrorism' and the post-graduate module 'Online Hate Crime and Extremism'. In addition, I lead the fortnightly [JDI Open](jdiopen.github.io) seminar series on open science practices and innovative statistical methods.

### Current Research Projects

* Information seeking and support for violent extremism: I examine the relationship between active selection of and incidental exposure to radicalising information online and offline and support for violent extremism
* Measurement invariance: Using data from the World Value Survey, I assess the importance of testing for measurement invariance in cross-national research 
* Public perceptions of measures to remove online hate speech: I explore how citizens perceive the distinction between online hate and free spech, current measures to remove online hate speech, and the freedom-security trade-off
