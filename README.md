I am a political psychologist at the UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science. My research examines factors that facilitate radicalisation and extreme political attitudes, online and offline.

#Current Research Projects
* The Social Ecology of Radicalisation: Where do people become radicalised? How are these settings characterised? Is there evidence for self-radicalisation online?
* Social Media and Support for the Populist Radical Right: Does social media use increase support for populist radical right parties?
* A Reinforcing Spiral of Populist Attitudes: Are populist attitudes and social media use mutually reinforced over time?
* Immigration and Votes for populist radical right parties in Europe: Does an increase in the size of the immigrant population in a country have long term effects on voting behaviour?
