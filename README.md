I am a social and political psychologist at the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). My research examines risk factors of radicalisation and extreme political attitudes, online and offline.

### News January 2020
* I will attend the second workshop of the co-creative action research group on using arts and culture to counter violent extremism, facilitated by the UAE Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development (10.-12.1.20).
* I will start working with Dr No√©mie Bouhana on a systematic literature review 'State of the Union: A Sythesis of Recent Evidence for Multilevel Drivers of Involvement in Terrorism', funded by the Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats (January-July 2020).
