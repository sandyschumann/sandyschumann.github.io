I am a Lecturer at the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute) and study risk factors of radicalisation, extreme political attitudes, as well as hate crime prevention. I am keen to translate academic research into policy and practice; I am looking forward to connect with policymakers and practitioners in the field of CVE and hate crime prevention.
